# Project Background

Here's the revised introduction that highlights the end-to-end aspect without using the "focusing" phrase:

Introduction
This project is an end-to-end data analysis journey, covering everything from data cleaning to visualization and analysis. It uses a real-world dataset from Kaggle featuring Amazon Indiaâ€™s clothing sales, with the aim of preparing the data for deep insights and actionable conclusions.

The project is structured into three key phases:

- **Python-Based Data Cleaning:**
In the initial phase, Python is used to perform basic cleaning operations such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats. The cleaned data is then converted into a CSV file that is compatible with SQL Server, making it ready for more advanced transformations.

- **SQL Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
The second phase involves using SQL for more comprehensive data cleaning and transformation. This process prepares the data for efficient analysis and visualization by ensuring it is well-structured and ready for exploration.

- **Popular Domestic Products Dashboard and Analysis:**
The final phase consists of building an interactive dashboard to analyze the most popular domestic products sold on Amazon India. By visualizing geographical and product category data, the dashboard provides deeper insights into customer preferences and sales trends, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The companies main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: table1, table2, table3, table4, with a total row count of X records. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Table 2:**
- **Table 3:**
- **Table 4:**
- **Table 5:**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
