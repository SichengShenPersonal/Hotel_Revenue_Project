# Project Background
Introduction
This project analyzes a real-world dataset from Kaggle, featuring Amazon Indiaâ€™s clothing sales data. Amazon India, a subsidiary of Amazon, is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in India, known for providing a wide range of products, including fashion, electronics, home goods, and more. It has become proficient in delivering products across the country, leveraging its vast logistics network and strong customer base.

In this project, the focus is on three key areas of analysis:

Together, these analyses will provide a comprehensive view of the sales dynamics in Amazon India's clothing category, with actionable insights for improving decision-making.
- **Popular Domestic Products Analysis:** This section identifies and analyzes the most popular clothing products sold domestically in India. By understanding which products are in high demand, we can gain insights into customer preferences and purchasing patterns.
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Here, I will explore overall sales trends to uncover patterns over time, such as seasonality, peak periods, or emerging trends in customer behavior. This can help in forecasting future demand and optimizing sales strategies.
- **International vs. Domestic Sales Trend Analysis:** This subsection compares the sales trends of products sold domestically in India versus those sold internationally. By comparing these trends, I aim to highlight differences in demand, product performance, and market behavior across different regions.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
